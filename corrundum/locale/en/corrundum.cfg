[space-location-name]
corrundum=Corrundum

[space-location-description]
corrundum=A planet blanketed in CO2 gas. Consequently, pressures and temperatures are high here. Runaway greenhouse effect has ensured conditions are harsher than Vulcanus, with no signs of life anywhere between the dirt and the lightning storms. High pressures ensure normally volatile petroleum gas is a liquid here - and there is a ton of it. Iron and copper are mostly locked up together as chalcopyrite. The metal of interest here is platinum, which is used as a catalyst in advanced sulfur processing and as an anode and cathode for electrochemistry. An entirely unique crafting chain centered around sulfur necessary to master this planet.

It is steam powered/pressurized and the high pressures inside the machine allows research to procede faster. However, it rejects science packs of normal quality - normal packs are not suited for the pressures in this machine.
red-boiler=A boiler designed to convert petroleum into hot CO2 gas. As we are trapping most of the gas, this does not produce a lot pollution
red-steam-engine=A modified steam engine. Uses the thermoelectric effect to produce energy. It is designed to take in hot CO2 gas, and produce power - at a significant pollution cost.
